The added context improves sentence structure and makes its predictions more accurate."

    "In particular, the [word_used2] creates a bigram, or a pair of two consecutive words, which the chatbot uses to track what word commonly follows that bigram and counts how often each next word appears. For example, from the sentence \"I am learning,\" the bigrams would be (\"I\", \"am\") and (\"am\", \"learning\"), and the chatbot would note that \"learning\" commonly follows (\"I\", \"am\"). By counting how frequently each next word occurs after a bigram, the chatbot builds a statistical model of word sequences. When generating new text, it uses these bigrams to predict the next word probabilistically, resulting in more natural, context-aware responses that better mimic human speech."
